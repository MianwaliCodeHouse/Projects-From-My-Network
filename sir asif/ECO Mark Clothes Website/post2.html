The brand's attention to detail is also reflected in the pants' features, such as hidden pockets for small items and adjustable waistbands for a perfect fit.
              <br><br>
              In addition to their sustainable materials and construction, the new pants line also reflects ECO Mark's commitment to ethical labor practices. The pants are manufactured in factories that meet the brand's high standards for fair wages and safe working conditions.
